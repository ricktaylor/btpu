1.  Introduction

   Bundle Protocol version 7 (BPv7) is defined in terms a layered
   logical architecture, detailed in [RFC9171], wherein the
   responsibility for the storing and routing of bundles lies with the
   Bundle Processing Agent (BPA), and the BPA relies upon Convergence
   Layer Adaptors (CLAs) to provide bundle transport between nodes.
   CLAs provide a unified interface to the BPA, allowing BPAs to be
   link-layer agnostic, but still use a diverse range of underlying
   link-layer protocols to transfer bundles between BPAs.

   In the realm of near- and deep-space communication there are a number
   of standardized link-layer protocols, including [USLP], [TM], [AOS],
   [DVB-S2X], that share a set of common properties:

   *  They are unidirectional.  Data transfer occurs in one direction
      only, there is no in-band return path for data.

   *  They are frame-based.  The link-layer protocol will guarantee that
      a frame of data is either delivered to the receiver in its
      entirety or not at all.  Frames may be of fixed or variable
      length.

   *  They are point-to-point.  Although the medium over which the data
      transfer occurs may be broadcast in nature, the link-layer
      protocol provides an uncontested point-to-point communication
      channel between a single sender and a single receiver.

   These characteristics provide a common baseline that allows the
   definition of a lightweight protocol for transferring BPv7 bundles
   meeting the requirements of a BPv7 CLA, and this document describes a
   protocol, Bundle Transfer Protocol - Unidirectional (BTP-U), suitable
   for implementation over any link-layer protocol that shares these
   characteristics.

   Although primarily designed for space communication, the protocol is
   applicable to other link-layer technologies which can share these
   characteristics, for example 5G Unstructured PDUs [_5G], or
   [IEEE.802.3], without requiring a full IP stack.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.1.  Terminology

   Within the scope of this document, the following terms have specific
   meaning:

   Bundle:  A higher-layer protocol data unit, typically a BPv7 Bundle
      as defined in [RFC9171].

   Link-layer PDU:  The protocol data unit, excluding any link-layer
      protocol specific headers or metadata, that makes up a complete
      transmission unit or frame, as defined by the link-layer protocol
      specification.

   Message:  A single protocol data item, see Section 7.

   Transfer:  The context in which the transmission of the Segments of a
      single Bundle occurs, see Section 4.

   Segment:  In order to transfer a Bundle larger than a Link-layer PDU,
      Bundles may be subdivided into Segments in order to fit within a
      Link-layer PDU, see Section 4.

3.  Protocol Overview

   The purpose of the protocol is to transfer a series of Bundles
   between two nodes.  Because a Bundle is of variable length, which is
   likely to not be exactly the same size as a Link-layer PDU, the
   protocol defines a mechanism to divide Bundles into Segments as
   required, such that each Link-layer PDU is efficiently filled with
   data, and one or more Bundles can be transferred in a minimal number
   of Link-layer PDUs, described in more detail in Section 4.

   This segmentation is unrelated to BPv7 bundle fragmentation as
   defined in Section 5.8 of [RFC9171].  Although BPv7 bundle
   fragmentation may be used to sub-divide oversized BPv7 bundles, the
   required duplication of metadata blocks can result in inefficiencies
   or fail to generate BPv7 bundle fragment small enough to fit in a
   single Link-layer PDU.

   As a sender may prioritize the transfer of each Bundle differently,
   the protocol allows for the multiplexing of Bundle transfers, so that
   the transfer of higher priority Bundles may interrupt the transfer of
   other Bundles, avoiding "head of line blocking", see Section 4.1 for
   more detail.

3.1.  Applicability

   The protocol has been designed to transfer BPv7 formatted Bundles,
   however it is equally capable of transferring any kind of binary
   data, but includes no explicit discriminator of the type of a
   particular Bundle.  If multiple different types of Bundle are to be
   transferred by a single implementation, this specification considers
   the differentiation between different Bundle types to be a matter for
   the implementation.  For example, both BPv6 ([RFC5050]) formatted
   Bundles and BPv7 Bundles can be multiplexed without issue, as the
   different formats can be distinguished by simple examination of the
   initial octets of a received Bundle by an implementation.
   Additionally, the segmentation mechanism enables the use of this
   protocol with Bundle formats that do not support some form of
   fragmentation.

   Although designed for any link-layer protocol that shares the
   characteristics defined in Section 1, additional specification or
   profiling may be required to map the constructs of the link-layer
   protocol to the mechanisms defined in this specification.

                    Protocol and a Link- layer protocol

3.2.  Messages

   The basic primitive of the protocol is the Message, a self-describing
   unit of protocol control information of variable length.  The sender
   is responsible for composing one or more Messages as required, and
   packing them into a Link-layer PDU, such that a single PDU is
   optimally filled.  The receiving node parses the contained Messages
   from each received Link-layer PDU, and then processes them as
   individual control signals.  This sequence of Messages from sender to
   receiver is the logical control-plane used by the protocol.  This
   document uses the verb "emit" to describe to the writing of a new
   Message to a Link-layer PDU ready for transmission, to differentiate
   from the the transmission of the Link-layer PDU itself, as many
   Messages may emitted prior to the transmission of the containing PDU.

   See Section 7 for detail of each type of Message.

3.3.  Padding

   Because the size of a Bundle is not expected to exactly match the
   size of a Link-layer PDU, an implementation will likely need to add
   padding to the PDU so that the Link-layer PDU size requirements are
   met.  Two Messages are available for this purpose: The Definite
   Padding Message (Section 7.7) and the Indefinite Padding Message
   (Section 7.8).  Padding Messages are valid at any point within a
   Link-layer PDU.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementations use the Definite Padding
   Message to add padding to a Link-layer PDU, except when less than
   four octets of padding are required, as the minimum length of the
   Definite Padding Message is four octets.

   When the link-layer protocol provides variable length Link-layer
   PDUs, implementations SHOULD take into account the mechanisms used by
   the link-layer protocol to support variable length Link-layer PDUs,
   and emit Link-layer PDUs of a suitable size for the underlying
   protocol.  For example, if variable length Link-layer PDUs are
   implemented by the link-layer protocol using a sub-framing mechanism,
   then emitting Link-layer PDUs of a single, or whole number of sub-
   frames may increase reliability.

   The algorithm used to pad and pack Messages efficiently into Link-
   layer PDUs is an implementation matter.

4.  Segmentation and Transfers

   As described in the Protocol Overview (Section 3), in order to
   transfer Bundles larger than a single Link-layer PDU into multiple
   PDUs, Bundles are be divided into a sequence of Segments by the
   sender and each Segment is emitted in its own a Message.  However, if
   a complete Bundle can fit in the next Link-layer PDU, then the Bundle
   SHOULD be transferred without segmentation, see the Bundle Message
   (Section 7.1).

   Each Segment is assigned a monotonically increasing integral sequence
   number, starting at zero (0).  In addition to a sequence number,
   every Segment has an associated Transfer that provides context to the
   sequence of Segments to enable the correct reassembly of the original
   Bundle.  Each Transfer is assigned a monotonically increasing number
   as an identifier, with each identified Transfer mapping to the
   segmentation of a single Bundle.

   The transfer of a sequence of Segments of a Bundle a sender MUST
   begin by emitting a Transfer Start Message (Section 7.2), carrying
   the Transfer identifier and the first Segment, which indicates a new
   Transfer is starting.  Further Segments, excluding the final Segment,
   MUST be emitted via the Transfer Segment Message (Section 7.3)
   carrying the same Transfer identifier.  The end of a sequence of
   Segments MUST be indicated by emitting a Transfer End Message
   (Section 7.5), including the final Segment and the identifier of the
   Transfer that is now complete.

   The receiver reassembles the transferred Bundle by concatenating the
   Segments that share a common Transfer number in the order of their
   sequence number.  When all the Segments have been received and
   concatenated, the receiver is assumed to pass the recombined Bundle
   to an upper layer for further processing.

   Transfer numbers are encoded using 24-bit unsigned integers.  To
   avoid placing a limit on the total number of Bundles that may be
   transferred between peers, numbers are allowed to "roll-over" via
   zero and repeat, i.e. the next number in the sequence is the previous
   number incremented by one, modulo 2^24.

4.1.  Interleaving Transfers

   In order to support the transmission of Bundles with different
   priorities, Transfer Messages associated with different Transfers,
   i.e. with different Transfer numbers, MAY be interleaved.  This
   allows senders to interrupt the emission of a sequence of Segments
   associated with one Transfer with one or more Segments of another
   Transfer, preventing a large lower priority Transfer blocking a
   higher priority Transfers.

4.2.  Cancelling Transfers

   A Transfer may be aborted by the sender while a Transfer is in
   progress by the emitting of a Transfer Cancel Message (Section 7.6)
   containing the identifier of the Transfer to cancel.

5.  Handling Link-layer PDU Loss

   Due to the unreliable nature of the link-layer protocol, Link-layer
   PDUs may be unexpectedly lost in transmission, resulting in the loss
   of the contained Messages.  Because the underlying link-layer is
   assumed to be unidirectional, the protocol does not include a
   mechanism to trigger the retransmission of lost Messages; instead the
   protocol allows the sender to repeat the transmission of Bundle
   segments.

   The protection mechanisms that follow are logically separate from any
   mechanism the underlying link-layer protocol may have to protect
   against information loss through redundancy and erasure coding, and
   may be used as required by a deployment.  If a link-layer protocol
   receives a duplicate transmission frame, it SHOULD be delivered to
   this protocol only once.

5.1.  Segment Repetition

   The repetition of Segments is logically separate from any mechanism
   the underlying link-layer protocol may have to repeat the
   transmission of frames, although both aim to protect against
   information loss through redundancy and may be used as required by a
   deployment.  If a link-layer protocol receives a duplicate
   transmission frame, it SHOULD be delivered to this protocol only
   once.

   TODO: The loss and repetition of Messages results in Transfer id
   being all over the place!

   TODO: A sender MAY repeatedly emit Transfer End and Transfer Cancel
   Messages.

5.2.  Forward Error Correction

   TODO: This protocol uses the framework defined in [RFC8681] for
   Forward Error Correction.  Configuration is performed out-of-band.
   FEC Instance ID is carried in Transfer Messages, and MUST be pre-
   agreed.  FEC Instance ID 0 means "No FEC".

6.  Transfer Window

   TODO: Rework into sliding window.

   A sender considers a Transfer to be "active" between emitting the
   first Transfer Start Message, and emitting the first Transfer End
   Message referencing the Transfer.

   Because Messages may be in transmission lost due to the loss of Link-
   layer PDUs, and a sender may emit duplicate Messages as a defense
   against loss, see Section 5.1, a receiver MUST consider a Transfer
   "active" from the reception of the first Transfer Start, Transfer
   Segment, or Transfer Repair Message, until reception of the first
   Transfer End or Transfer Cancel Message.

7.  Message Definitions

   All protocol Messages except the Indefinite Padding Message
   (Section 7.8) follow the common "Type-Length-Value" formatting
   pattern, with each Message being identified by a four octet header
   that encodes the type of the Message, and the length of the content
   of the Message.

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | Type          | Length (24-bit unsigned integer)              |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                       ... Content ...                         :
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Type:  The type of the Message, allocated from IANA "BTP-U Message
      Types" registry, expressed as a 8-bit unsigned integer in network
      byte order.

   Length:  The length of the Message in octets, excluding the 4 octets
      of the header itself, expressed as a 24-bit unsigned integer in
      network byte order.

   Content:  A sequence of octets of data of variable length determined
      by the corresponding Length field value, encoded according to the
      type of the Message.

7.1.  Bundle Message

   The Bundle Message is used to encapsulate an entire Bundle, and
   SHOULD be used by an implementation when a Bundle will fit in its
   entirety in a single Link-layer PDU to avoid the overhead of
   segmentation, and reducing the risk of the total loss of a Bundle if
   one or more unnecessary segments of a Bundle is lost.

   A Bundle Message has a type of TBD.  The Message Content MUST be a
   valid Bundle.

   Emitting a Bundle Message with a Length field value of zero (0), i.e
   no Bundle content, only adds control-plane overhead and SHOULD NOT be
   used as an alternative form of padding.

7.2.  Transfer Start Message

   The Transfer Start Message is used to encapsulate the first segment
   of a new multi-segment Bundle Transfer.

   A Transfer Start Message has a type of TBD.  The Message Content
   field is formatted as follows:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | Transfer Number                               | FEC ID        |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | Total Transfer Length                                         :
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   :                         ... Total Transfer Length (continued) |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                    ... Segment Data ...                       :
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Transfer Number:  The numeric identifier of the new Transfer that is
      starting, encoded as a 24-bit unsigned integer in network byte
      order.

   FEC ID:  The FEC Instance ID, see Forward Error Correction
      (Section 5.2).

   Total Transfer Length:  The total length of the reassembled Bundle,
      encoded as a 64-bit unsigned integer in network byte order.

   Segment Data:  The octets of the first Segment of the Transfer, with
      the length calculated as the Message content length excluding the
      12 octets of the Transfer Number, FEC Instance, and Total Transfer
      Length.

   So that a receiving implementation may preallocate the buffers
   required to reassemble the segmented Bundle, the Total Transfer
   Length field contains the total length of the Bundle to be
   reassembled.

   To reduce signalling overhead, the Transfer Start Message does not
   include a Segment Sequence Number field as the sequence number is
   implicitly zero (0).

   The Transfer Number field value MUST NOT match the numeric identifier
   of a currently in-progress (Section 6) Transfer.

   Transfer Start Messages SHOULD NOT have zero octets of Segment Data,
   i.e. the total length of the Message SHOULD be greater than 16
   octets.  The Total Transfer Length field value SHOULD NOT be zero, as
   a zero-length Bundle is not a valid Transfer.  Such Messages only add
   control-plane overhead and SHOULD NOT be used as an alternative form
   of padding.

7.3.  Transfer Segment Message

   The Transfer Segment Message is used to encapsulate the next segment
   of an in-progress multi-segment Bundle Transfer.

   A Transfer Segment Message has a type of TBD.  The Message Content
   field is formatted as follows:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | Transfer Number                               | FEC ID        |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | Segment Sequence Number                                       |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                    ... Segment Data ...                       :
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Transfer Number:  The numeric identifier of the in-progress
      (Section 6) Transfer that this Segment is part of, encoded as a
      24-bit unsigned integer in network byte order.

   FEC ID:  The FEC Instance ID, see Forward Error Correction
      (Section 5.2).

   Segment Sequence Number:  The non-zero sequence number of the
      Segment, encoded as a 32-bit unsigned integer in network byte
      order.

   Segment Data:  The octets of a Segment of the Transfer, with the
      length calculated as the Message content length excluding the
      eight (8) octets of the Transfer Number, FEC Instance, and Segment
      Sequence Number.

   Transfer Segment Messages SHOULD NOT have zero octets of Segment
   Data, i.e. the total length of the Message SHOULD be greater than 12
   octets.  Such Messages only add control-plane overhead and SHOULD NOT
   be used as an alternative form of padding.

7.4.  Transfer Repair Message

   The Transfer Repair Message is used to carry repair information when
   Forward Error Correction is in use, see Section 5.2.  This message
   corresponds to the "Repair Packet" in Section 5.1 of [RFC6363].

   A Transfer Repair Message has a type of TBD.  The Message Content
   field is formatted as follows:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | Transfer Number                               | FEC ID        |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | Segment Sequence Number                                       |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | Segment Data Length                                           |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                 ... Segment Repair Data ...                   :
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Transfer Number:  The numeric identifier of the in-progress
      (Section 6) Transfer that this Segment is part of, encoded as a
      24-bit unsigned integer in network byte order.

   FEC ID:  The FEC Instance ID, see Forward Error Correction
      (Section 5.2).

   Segment Sequence Number:  The non-zero sequence number of the
      Segment, encoded as a 32-bit unsigned integer in network byte
      order.

   Segment Data Length:  The length of the Segment data to be repaired,
      corresponding to the "Source Packet" in Section 5.1 of [RFC6363].

   Segment Repair Data:  The octets of the repair data for a Segment of
      the Transfer, with the length calculated as the Message content
      length excluding the 12 octets of the Transfer Number, FEC
      Instance, Segment Sequence Number, and Segment Data Length.

   Transfer Repair Messages SHOULD NOT have zero octets of Segment
   Repair Data, i.e. the total length of the Message SHOULD be greater
   than 16 octets.  Such Messages only add control-plane overhead and
   SHOULD NOT be used as an alternative form of padding.

7.5.  Transfer End Message

   The Transfer End Message is used to encapsulate the last segment of a
   multi-segment Bundle Transfer, and complete the Transfer.

   A Transfer End Message has a type of TBD.  The Message Content field
   is formatted as follows:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | Transfer Number                               | FEC ID        |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | Segment Sequence Number                                       |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                    ... Segment Data ...                       :
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Transfer Number:  The numeric identifier of the in-progress
      (Section 6) Transfer that is completing, encoded as a 24-bit
      unsigned integer in network byte order.

   FEC ID:  The FEC Instance ID, see Forward Error Correction
      (Section 5.2).

   Segment Sequence Number:  The non-zero sequence number of the final
      Segment, encoded as a 32-bit unsigned integer in network byte
      order.

   Segment Data:  The octets of the final Segment of the Transfer, with
      the length calculated as the Message content length excluding the
      eight (8) octets of the Transfer Number, FEC Instance, and Segment
      Sequence Number.

   Transfer End Messages SHOULD NOT have zero octets of Segment Data,
   i.e. the total length of the Message SHOULD be greater than 12
   octets.  Such Messages only add control-plane overhead and SHOULD NOT
   be used as an alternative form of padding.

7.6.  Transfer Cancel Message

   The Transfer Cancel Message is used to indicate that the indicated
   Transfer is being aborted, and any prior or later received Segments
   associated with the Transfer MUST be discarded by the receiver.

   A Transfer Cancel Message has a type of TBD.  The Message Content
   field is formatted as follows:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | Transfer Number                               | MBZ           |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Transfer Number:  The numeric identifier of the in-progress
      (Section 6) Transfer that is cancelled, encoded as a 24-bit
      unsigned integer in network byte order.

   MBZ:  "Must Be Zero".  One octet with no semantic meaning.  A sender
      SHOULD set this field value to zero (0).  A receiver MUST ignore
      this value.

   The Transfer Cancel Message has no content, and hence has a fixed
   length of 4 octets.

   A peer that receives a Transfer Cancel Message with a Transfer Number
   field value that does not match the numeric identifier of an
   in-progress (Section 6) Transfer MUST ignore the Message.

7.7.  Definite Padding Message

   The Definite Padding Message is used to add padding to a Link-layer
   PDU.

   A Definite Padding Message has a type of TBD.  Any content it
   contains has no semantic meaning, and a sender SHOULD set the content
   to a sequence of zero (0) octets.  A receiver MUST ignore any Message
   content.

   It is valid for this Message to have no content, i.e. a Length field
   value of zero (0), adding a total of four (4) octets of padding to
   the Link-layer PDU.

7.8.  Indefinite Padding Message

   An Indefinite Padding Message has a type of zero (0), and in order to
   support padding with a minimum total length of one octet, the Message
   does not include an explicit Length or Content field, and hence has
   the following layout:

    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | Type          |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Type:  The type of the Message: zero (0).

   The Indefinite Padding Message type field is followed by a sequence
   of zero or more zero (0) octets, ending at the first non-zero octet,
   or the end of the fixed-length Link-layer PDU.  The content of the
   Message has no meaning, and MUST be ignored by a receiver.

   Note: When a Indefinite Padding Message terminates with a non-zero
   octet, the non-zero octet is the first octet of the subsequent
   Message.

8.  Security Considerations

   This protocol does not define any measures to protect Messages or
   their content.  Although there may be link-layer mechanisms to
   protect the transmission of frames against over-hearing and
   interference, transport-layer security is considered out of scope for
   the protocol.  Mechanisms such as BPSec, defined in [RFC9172], MUST
   be used to provide integrity and protection at the Bundle layer as
   required.

9.  Deployment Considerations

   The following caveats should be considered before deploying instances
   of this protocol:

   1.  It is unreliable.  Although there may be a link-layer protocol
       mechanism for a receiver to be notified that a frame has been
       lost in transmission, due to the unidirectional nature of the
       link-layer there is no in-band return path suitable for higher-
       layer acknowledgement of transfer success.  Any acknowledgement
       system designed to provide reliability MUST use a logically
       separate path from receiver back to sender.

   2.  It does not provide congestion control or signalling.  The
       underlying link-layer is expected to provide an uncontested
       point-to-point channel, and hence such mechanisms are considered
       to be out of scope.  The protocol MUST NOT be deployed in
       environments where congestion may occur, such as the public
       Internet, when the underlying link-layer, or a higher layer, does
       not provide suitable congestion control.

   3.  It requires an out-of-band mechanism for configuration.  This can
       either be via pre-placed static configuration, a parallel dynamic
       control-plane protocol, or some other mechanism beyond the scope
       of this specification.

10.  IANA Considerations

   TODO Need a new registry!

   TODO Reserve some codepoints for CLs

Appendix A.  Examples

A.1.  Segmentation of a sequence of Bundles of equal priority

   An example of the transmission of three Bundles of varying sizes and
   equal priority in three Link-layer PDUs is shown in Figure 2.

  +---------------------------+------------+-----------------+
  | Bundle A                  | Bundle B   | Bundle C        |
  +---------------------------+------------+-----------------+

  :                           :            :                 :

  +----------------------+----+------------+----+------------+---------+
  | Transfer 1           | T1 |  Complete  | T2 | Transfer 2 | Padding |
  | Segment 0            | S1 |  Bundle    | S0 | Segment 1  |         |
  +----------------------+----+------------+----+------------+---------+

  :                      :                      :                      :

  +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
  | Link-layer PDU N     | Link-layer PDU N + 1 | Link-layer PDU N + 2 |
  +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+

    Figure 2: Segmentation of a sequence of Bundles of equal priority

   Bundle A is transferred as two Segments, included in the first and
   second Link-layer PDU, as Transfer 1.  Bundle B fits completely in
   the second Link-layer PDU, and is therefore transferred without
   segmentation.  Bundle C is transferred as two Segments split between
   the second and third PDU, but padding is required to fill the third
   PDU.  An alternative algorithm could have selected to not segment
   Bundle C, but to pad the second PDU and include Bundle C without
   segmentation in the third PDU, without changing the semantics, as an
   implementation preference.

A.2.  Segmentation of a sequence of Bundles of different priority

   An example of the transmission of three Bundles of varying sizes and
   different priority in three Link-layer PDUs is shown in Figure 3.

          +---------------------------+
          | Bundle B                  |  Priority 0
          +---------------------------+
  +--------------+-----------------+
  | Bundle A     | Bundle C        |     Priority 1
  +--------------+-----------------+


  +----------------------+------------+----+----+------------+---------+
  | T1    | Transfer 2   | Transfer 2 | T1 | T3 | Transfer 3 | Padding |
  | S0    | Segment 0    | Segment 1  | S1 | S0 | Segment 1  |         |
  +----------------------+------------+----+----+------------+---------+

  :                      :                      :                      :

  +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
  | Link-layer PDU N     | Link-layer PDU N + 1 | Link-layer PDU N + 2 |
  +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
