               Bundle Transfer Protocol - Unidirectional
                       draft-ietf-dtn-btpu-latest

Abstract

   This document defines a protocol for the unidirectional transfer of
   large binary objects, typically Bundle Protocol version 7 bundles,
   between two nodes connected by a unidirectional, unreliable, frame-
   based link-layer protocol, without requiring IP services.

   The protocol does not require a return path for acknowledgements, but
   instead supports data repetition as a mechanism to protect against
   data loss.  It fully supports the disaggregation of flows of binary
   objects of different priority, preventing head-of-line blocking
   impacting performance.

   The wire format of the protocol is designed to enable performant
   implementation in hardware or software, with the aim of enabling
   protocol implementations to run at the line-rate of the underlying
   link-layer protocol.

1.  Introduction

   Bundle Protocol version 7 (BPv7) is defined in terms a layered
   logical architecture, detailed in [RFC9171], wherein the
   responsibility for the storing and routing of bundles lies with the
   Bundle Processing Agent (BPA), and the BPA relies upon Convergence
   Layer Protocols (CLAs) to provide bundle transport between nodes.
   CLAs provide a unified interface to the BPA, allowing BPAs to be
   link-layer agnostic, but still use a diverse range of Convergence
   Layer Protocols (CLPs) to transfer bundles between BPAs over
   underlying link-layer protocols.

   In the realm of near- and deep-space communication there are a number
   of standardized link-layer protocols, including [USLP], [TM], [AOS],
   [DVB-S2X], that share a set of common properties:

   *  They are unidirectional: data transfer occurs in one direction
      only, there is no in-band return path for data.

   *  They are frame-based: the link-layer protocol will guarantee that
      a frame of data is either delivered to a receiver in its entirety
      or not at all.  Frames may be of fixed or variable length.

   *  They provide a single logical channel: the communication between a
      sender and one or more receivers of frames can be logically
      separated from other communication over the link-layer by an
      implementation, perhaps by the use of channel identifiers, circuit
      identifiers, or tuples of source and destination address
      information.

   These characteristics provide a common baseline that allows the
   definition of a lightweight mechanism for transferring BPv7 bundles
   meeting the requirements of a BPv7 Convergence Layer Protocol, and
   this document describes such a protocol: Bundle Transfer Protocol -
   Unidirectional (BTPU), suitable for implementation over any link-
   layer protocol that shares these characteristics.  The protocol is
   applicable to other link-layer technologies which share these
   characteristics beyond those commonly used for space communication,
   for example 5G Unstructured PDUs [_5G], or Ethernet [IEEE.802.3],
   without requiring underlying IP services.  Although designed for any
   link-layer protocol that shares the characteristics above, additional
   specification or profiling may be required to map the constructs of
   the link-layer protocol to the mechanisms defined in this
   specification.

   The driving use-case of the protocol has been the transfer of BPv7
   Bundles, however it is equally capable of transferring any kind of
   binary data, but includes no explicit discriminator of the format of
   a particular block of binary data.  If multiple different types of
   binary data are to be transferred by a single implementation, this
   specification considers the differentiation between different types
   of binary data to be a matter for the implementation.  For example,
   both BPv6 Bundles ([RFC5050]) and BPv7 Bundles can be multiplexed
   without issue, as the different formats can be distinguished by
   simple examination of the initial octets of a received bundle by an
   implementation.  Additionally, the segmentation mechanism enables the
   use of this protocol with binary data formats that do not natively
   support some form of fragmentation.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.1.  Terminology

   Within the scope of this document, the following terms have specific
   meaning:

   Bundle:  A higher-layer protocol data unit, typically a BPv7 Bundle
      as defined in [RFC9171].

   Link-layer PDU:  The protocol data unit, excluding any link-layer
      protocol specific headers or metadata, that makes up a complete
      transmission unit or frame, as defined by the link-layer protocol
      specification.

   Message:  A single protocol data item, see Section 8.

   Segment:  In order to transfer a Bundle larger than a Link-layer PDU,
      Bundles may be subdivided into Segments in order to fit within a
      Link-layer PDU, see Section 4.

   Transfer:  The context in which the transmission of the Segments of a
      single Bundle occurs, see Section 4.

3.  Protocol Overview

   The purpose of the protocol is to transfer a series of Bundles
   between two nodes.  Because a Bundle is of variable length, which is
   unlikely to be exactly the same size as a Link-layer PDU, the
   protocol defines a mechanism to divide Bundles into Segments as
   required, such that each Link-layer PDU is efficiently filled with
   data, and one or more Bundles can be transferred in a minimal number
   of Link-layer PDUs, described in more detail in Section 4.

   This segmentation is unrelated to BPv7 bundle fragmentation as
   defined in Section 5.8 of [RFC9171].  Although BPv7 bundle
   fragmentation may be used to sub-divide oversized BPv7 bundles, the
   required duplication of metadata blocks can result in inefficiencies
   or fail to generate BPv7 bundle fragment small enough to fit in a
   single Link-layer PDU.

   As a sender may prioritize the transfer of each Bundle differently,
   the protocol allows for the multiplexing of Bundle transfers, so that
   the transfer of higher priority Bundles may interrupt the transfer of
   other Bundles, avoiding "head of line blocking", see Section 4.1 for
   more detail.  The bundle transfers are expected to occur over the
   same logical channel, rather than using a separate channel for each
   bundle or group of bundles that share priority.  This does not
   preclude using multiple logical channels, but each channel is
   expected to be an independent instance of the protocol.

3.1.  Messages

   The basic primitive of the protocol is the Message, a self-describing
   unit of protocol control information of variable length.  The sender
   is responsible for composing one or more Messages as required, and
   packing them into a Link-layer PDU, such that a single PDU is
   optimally filled.  The receiving node parses the contained Messages
   from each received Link-layer PDU, and then processes them as
   individual control signals.  This sequence of Messages is the logical
   control-plane used by the protocol.  This document uses the verb
   "emit" to describe to the writing of a new Message to a Link-layer
   PDU ready for transmission, to differentiate from the the
   transmission of the Link-layer PDU itself, as many Messages may
   emitted prior to the transmission of the containing PDU.

   See Section 8 for detail of each type of Message.

3.2.  Padding

   Because the size of a Bundle is not expected to exactly match the
   size of a Link-layer PDU, an implementation will likely need to add
   padding to the PDU so that the Link-layer PDU size requirements are
   met.  Two Messages are available for this purpose: The Definite
   Padding Message (Section 8.5) and the Indefinite Padding Message
   (Section 8.6).  Padding Messages are valid at any point within a
   Link-layer PDU.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementations use the Definite Padding
   Message to add padding to a Link-layer PDU, except when less than
   four octets of padding are required, as the minimum length of the
   Definite Padding Message is four octets.

   When the link-layer protocol provides variable length Link-layer
   PDUs, implementations SHOULD take into account the mechanisms used by
   the link-layer protocol to support variable length Link-layer PDUs,
   and emit Link-layer PDUs of a suitable size for the underlying
   protocol.  For example, if variable length Link-layer PDUs are
   implemented by the link-layer protocol using a sub-framing mechanism,
   then emitting Link-layer PDUs of a single, or whole number of sub-
   frames may increase reliability.

   The algorithm used to pad and pack Messages efficiently into Link-
   layer PDUs is an implementation matter.

4.  Segmentation and Transfers

   As described in the Protocol Overview (Section 3), in order to
   transfer Bundles larger than a single Link-layer PDU into multiple
   PDUs, Bundles are be divided into a sequence of Segments by the
   sender and each Segment is emitted in its own a Message.  However, if
   a complete Bundle can fit in the next Link-layer PDU, then the Bundle
   SHOULD be transferred without segmentation, see the Bundle Message
   (Section 8.1).

   Each Segment is assigned a monotonically decreasing integral Segment
   Index that indicates the relative position of the Segment within the
   total sequence of Segments, with zero (0) indicating the final
   segment; i.e Segments are ordered N to 0, where N is the Segment
   Index in the Transfer Start Message.

   The start of a transfer of a sequence of Segments MUST be indicated
   by emitting a Transfer Start Message (Section 8.2), including the
   index of the first Segment and the identifier of the Transfer that is
   now complete.  The remaining Segments of a Bundle MUST be emitted by
   the sender as a series of Transfer Segment Messages (Section 8.3)
   carrying the same Transfer identifier.

   In addition to a Segment Index, every Segment is associated with a
   Transfer that provides context to the sequence of Segments to enable
   the correct reassembly of the original Bundle.  Each Transfer is
   assigned a number as an identifier, with each identified Transfer
   mapping to the segmentation of a single Bundle.

   Transfer numbers are expressed as 32-bit unsigned integers.  A
   sending implementation SHOULD choose a random value between 0 and
   2^32-1 for the first Transfer number, and each subsequent Transfer
   MUST use the next numeric value in the sequence.  To avoid placing a
   limit on the total number of Transfers between peers, numbers are
   allowed to "roll-over" to zero and repeat, i.e. the next number in
   the sequence is the previous number incremented by one, modulo 2^32.

   A receiver reassembles the transferred Bundle by concatenating the
   Segments that share a common Transfer number in the descending order
   of their Segment Index.  Once all the Segments have been received and
   concatenated, a receiver is expected to pass the recombined Bundle to
   an upper layer for further processing.

4.1.  Interleaving Transfers

   In order to support the transmission of Bundles with different
   priorities, Transfer Messages associated with different Transfers,
   i.e. with different Transfer numbers, MAY be interleaved.  This
   allows senders to interrupt the emission of a sequence of Segments
   associated with one Transfer with one or more Segments of another
   Transfer, preventing a large lower priority Transfer blocking a
   higher priority Transfers.

4.2.  Cancelling Transfers

   A Transfer may be aborted by the sender while a Transfer is in
   progress by the emitting of a Transfer Cancel Message (Section 8.4)
   containing the identifier of the Transfer to cancel.  A receiver of a
   Transfer Cancel Message SHOULD discard any segments already received
   and MUST ignore any further Messages associated with the Transfer.

5.  Transfer Window

   Because Messages may be lost in transmission due to the loss of Link-
   layer PDUs, and a sender may emit duplicate Messages as a defense
   against loss, see Section 6, a sender MUST maintain a sliding
   Transfer Window that defines the maximum number of Transfers that can
   be simultaneously in progress.  As Transfers are identified by a
   monotonically increasing number, the size of the Transfer Window also
   strictly defines the range of identifiers of Transfers in progress.

   The sender MUST maintain a reference to the greatest Transfer number
   used in any emitted Message, and MUST NOT emit any Message with a
   Transfer number less than or equal to the latest minus the size of
   the Transfer Window, taking into account the modulo 2^32 roll-over.

   Each receiver MUST maintain a reference to the greatest Transfer
   number received in any Message.  When a Transfer Message is received
   with a Transfer number greater than the greatest previously received,
   the new Transfer number is considered the greatest Transfer number,
   and Transfers with number less than or equal to the latest minus the
   size of the Transfer Window MUST be considered Section 4.2.  Because
   of Transfer number roll-over, half the number space of 2^32 and
   window size is used to determine if a number is older or newer than
   the latest Transfer number.  Pseudocode for the algorithm is given in
   Figure 2.

   The size of the Transfer Window SHOULD be the same at the sender and
   all receivers, and MUST be configured via some out-of-band mechanism.
   The Transfer Window size MUST be at least 4, MUST be less than 2^12,
   and is RECOMMENDED to be 16.
   // 16 is an arbitrary number, and needs discussing by the WG.

   const WINDOW_SIZE  # Configured transfer window size
   var GREATEST = NIL # Greatest received transfer number, initially NIL

   # Function to check if a transfer is valid within the current window
   FUNCTION isTransferValid(T):
       # Ensure Transfer T is within the
       #  sliding window defined by WINDOW_SIZE
       RETURN ((GREATEST - T + 2^32) MOD 2^32) < WINDOW_SIZE

   # Function to check if the transfer is considered a "new" transfer
   FUNCTION isNewTransfer(T):
       IF GREATEST IS NIL THEN
           # The first transfer is always considered new
           RETURN TRUE
       # Check if the transfer is within the valid window range
       #  (half of the number space + window size)
       RETURN ((T - GREATEST + 2^32) MOD 2^32) <
                        (2^32 / 2) + (WINDOW_SIZE / 2)

   # Main function to process a transfer and manage the sliding window
   FUNCTION processTransfer(T):
       IF isNewTransfer(T) THEN
           # New transfer, update the greatest received transfer number
           GREATEST ← T
           # Cancel transfers that are now outside the window
           CANCEL_OUTDATED_TRANSFERS()
       ELSE IF isTransferValid(T) THEN
           # Transfer is in progress, continue handling it
           CONTINUE_PROCESSING(T)
       ELSE
           # Transfer is invalid (outside the window), ignore it
           IGNORE_MESSAGE(T)

6.  Handling Link-layer PDU Loss

   Due to the unreliable nature of the link-layer protocol, Link-layer
   PDUs may be lost in transmission, resulting in the loss of the
   contained Messages.  Because the underlying link-layer is assumed to
   be unidirectional, the protocol does not include a mechanism to
   trigger the retransmission of lost Messages; instead the protocol
   allows the sender to repeat the transmission of Messages.

   A sender MAY emit any Message multiple times in different Link-layer
   PDUs.  Although every Link-layer PDU transmitted may contain
   different Messages, any repeated Message MUST be an exact copy of an
   already emitted Message.  When segmenting bundles, not all Messages
   in a Transfer need be repeated the same number of times, and
   different Transfers may repeat Messages differently.

   Although it is RECOMMENDED that Transfer Segment Messages
   (Section 8.3) are emitted in descending order of Segment Index; once
   emitted, any Message MAY be repeated any number of times, in any
   order.  The number of repetitions of a particular Message is an
   implementation matter that can be influenced by many factors,
   including:

   *  Offline analysis of the deployed environment may require a certain
      amount of Message repetition to reach some required certainty of
      transfer.

   *  A higher 'reliability' factor associated with a particular Bundle
      may result in more copies of each associated Transfer Message
      being emitted.

   *  Signalling from the link-layer protocol, or some other out-of-band
      mechanism, may trigger increased repetition of a subset Messages,
      to protect against some temporary spike in Link-layer PDU loss
      rate.

   Message replication is logically separate from any facilities the
   underlying link-layer protocol may have to protect against
   information loss through redundancy and/or erasure coding, and may be
   used as required by a deployment.  If a link-layer protocol receives
   a duplicate Link-layer PDU, it SHOULD be delivered to this protocol
   only once.

7.  Message Format

   All protocol Messages except the Indefinite Padding Message
   (Section 8.6) follow the common "Type-Length-Value" formatting
   pattern, with each Message being identified by a four octet header
   that encodes the type of the Message, and the length of the content
   of the Message.

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |     Type      |Flags|      Length (20-bit unsigned int)       |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |              ... Optional Metadata Items ...                  :
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                       ... Content ...                         :
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Type:  The type of the Message, allocated from IANA "BTPU Message
      Types" registry, see Section 12, encoded as a 8-bit unsigned
      integer in network byte order.

   Flags:  A 4-bit field for flags, see Section 7.1.

   Length:  The length of the Message in octets, excluding the 4 octets
      of the header itself, encoded as a 20-bit unsigned integer in
      network byte order.  This length includes both the optional
      Metadata Items (Section 7.2) and the Content.

   Content:  A sequence of octets of data.  Its length is the main
      Message Length minus the total length of any present Metadata
      Items.  The content is encoded according to the Type of the
      Message.

7.1.  Message Flags

   The Message Flags field is a 4-bit
   // 4 bits is considered enough, as it allows a 20-bit Message Length
   // field, and many additional flags could be better expressed with
   // Metadata Items. field, formatted as follows:

    0 1 2 3
   +-+-+-+-+
   |M| RFU |
   +-+-+-+-+

   M:  The 'M' (Metadata) flag.  If this bit is set to 1, it indicates
      that one or more Metadata Items are present immediately following
      the Message header.

   RFU (Reserved for Future Use):  These 3 bits are unassigned.  They
      MUST be set to zero by the sender and MUST be ignored by the
      receiver.

7.2.  Metadata Items

   To allow the transfer of optional additional information, Messages
   can carry extra information in the form of Metadata Items.  Because
   Messages may be lost in transmission, this metadata provides
   additional information about the Transfer itself, rather than being
   particular to the containing Message, and may be repeated in multiple
   different or repeated Messages.

   If the 'M' flag is set in the Message header, the header is followed
   by one or more Metadata Items.  Each item is encoded in a Type-
   Length-Value format, with a 2-octet header followed by a variable-
   length value.  This format intentionally omits a flags field to
   prevent nested metadata.

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | Metadata Type |    Length     |       ... Value ...           :
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Metadata Type:  An 8-bit identifier for the Metadata Item, allocated
      from the "BTPU Metadata Types" IANA registry, see Section 12,
      encoded as a 8-bit unsigned integer in network byte order.

   Length:  An 8-bit unsigned integer specifying the length of the Value
      field in octets.  This limits the value of a single Metadata Item
      to 255 octets.

   Value:  The payload of the Metadata Item.

8.  Message Definitions

   The following standard protocol Messages are defined:

8.1.  Bundle Message

   The Bundle Message is used to encapsulate an entire Bundle, and
   SHOULD be used by an implementation when a Bundle will fit in its
   entirety in a single Link-layer PDU to avoid the overhead of
   segmentation, and reducing the risk of the total loss of a Bundle if
   one or more unnecessary segments of a Bundle is lost.

   A Bundle Message has a type of 2.  The Message Content MUST be a
   valid Bundle.

   Emitting a Bundle Message with a Length field value that indicates no
   Bundle content (e.g., a length of 0 if no metadata is present) only
   adds control-plane overhead and SHOULD NOT be used as an alternative
   form of padding.

8.2.  Transfer Start Message

   The Transfer Start Message is used to indicate the beginning of a new
   multi-segment Bundle Transfer, and encapsulate the first segment.

   A Transfer Start Message has a type of 3.  The Message Content field
   is formatted as follows:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | Transfer Number                                               |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | Segment Index                                                 |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                    ... Segment Data ...                       :
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Transfer Number:  The numeric identifier of the in-progress
      (Section 5) Transfer that is beginning, encoded as a 32-bit
      unsigned integer in network byte order.

   Segment Index:  The non-zero Segment Index of the first Segment,
      encoded as a 32-bit unsigned integer in network byte order.

   Segment Data:  The octets of the first Segment of the Transfer, with
      the length calculated as the Message content length excluding the
      eight (8) octets of the Transfer Number and Segment Index.

   Transfer Start Messages SHOULD NOT have zero octets of Segment Data,
   i.e. the total length of the Message SHOULD be greater than 12
   octets.  Such Messages only add control-plane overhead and SHOULD NOT
   be used as an alternative form of padding.

8.3.  Transfer Segment Message

   The Transfer Segment Message is used to encapsulate a segment of a
   multi-segment Bundle Transfer.

   A Transfer Segment Message has a type of 4.  The Message Content
   field is formatted as follows:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | Transfer Number                                               |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | Segment Index                                                 |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                    ... Segment Data ...                       :
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Transfer Number:  The numeric identifier of the Transfer that this
      Segment is part of, encoded as a 32-bit unsigned integer in
      network byte order.

   Segment Index:  The position of the Segment within the sequence of
      all Segments of a Transfer, encoded as a 32-bit unsigned integer
      in network byte order.

   Segment Data:  The octets of a Segment of the Transfer, with the
      length calculated as the Message content length excluding the
      eight (8) octets of the Transfer Number and Segment Index.

   Transfer Segment Messages SHOULD NOT have zero octets of Segment
   Data, i.e. the total length of the Message SHOULD be greater than 12
   octets.  Such Messages only add control-plane overhead and SHOULD NOT
   be used as an alternative form of padding.

8.4.  Transfer Cancel Message

   The Transfer Cancel Message is used to indicate that the indicated
   Transfer is being aborted, and any prior or later received Segments
   associated with the Transfer MUST be discarded by a receiver.

   A Transfer Cancel Message has a type of 5.  The Message Content field
   is formatted as follows:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | Transfer Number                                               |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Transfer Number:  The numeric identifier of the in-progress
      (Section 5) Transfer that is cancelled, encoded as a 32-bit
      unsigned integer in network byte order.

   The Transfer Cancel Message has no content, and hence has a fixed
   length of 4 octets.

   A peer that receives a Transfer Cancel Message with a Transfer Number
   field value that does not match the numeric identifier of an
   in-progress (Section 5) Transfer MUST ignore the Message.

8.5.  Definite Padding Message

   The Definite Padding Message is used to add padding to a Link-layer
   PDU.

   A Definite Padding Message has a type of 1.  Any content it contains
   has no semantic meaning, and a sender SHOULD set the content to a
   sequence of zero (0) octets.  Receivers MUST ignore any Message
   content.

   It is valid for this Message to have no content, i.e. a Length field
   value of zero (0), adding a total of four (4) octets of padding to
   the Link-layer PDU.

8.6.  Indefinite Padding Message

   An Indefinite Padding Message has a type of zero (0), and in order to
   support padding with a minimum total length of one octet, the Message
   does not include an explicit Length or Content field, and hence has
   the following layout:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | Type (0)      |                  ... Padding ...              :
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Type:  The type of the Message: zero (0).

   The Indefinite Padding Message type field is followed by a sequence
   of zero or more zero (0) octets, ending at the first non-zero octet,
   or the end of the fixed-length Link-layer PDU.  The content of the
   Message has no meaning, and MUST be ignored by a receiver.

   Note: When a Indefinite Padding Message terminates with a non-zero
   octet, the non-zero octet is the first octet of the subsequent
   Message.

9.  Standard Metadata

   The following Metadata Items are defined in this document:

9.1.  Bundle Length Metadata

   The Bundle Length Metadata Item is used to signal the total length of
   a bundle that is being transferred in segments.  This allows a
   receiver to pre-allocate the necessary memory to reassemble the
   complete bundle.

   This Metadata Item MAY be included in a Transfer Start Message or a
   Transfer Segment Message.

   The Metadata Item has a Metadata Type of 1, and its layout is as
   follows:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |   Type (1)    |    Length     |  ... Bundle Length ...        :
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Length:  The length of the Bundle Length field.  This MUST be one of
      1, 2, 4, or 8.

   Bundle Length:  The total length of the bundle being transferred,
      encoded as an unsigned integer in network byte order, with a size
      corresponding to the Length field.

   A sender SHOULD choose the smallest possible length that can
   accommodate the total bundle length.  For example, a bundle of 2000
   octets should be encoded with a Length of 2, and a Value of 2000
   encoded as a 16-bit unsigned integer.

10.  Security Considerations

   This protocol does not define any measures to protect Messages or
   their content.  There may be link-layer mechanisms to protect the
   transmission of frames against over-hearing and interference, and
   upper layer mechanisms, such as BPSec defined in [RFC9172], can be
   used to provide integrity and protection at a higher layer.
   Therefore transport-layer security is considered out of scope for the
   protocol, and lower and/or upper layer mechanisms MUST be used to
   provide security.

11.  Deployment Considerations

   The following caveats should be considered before deploying instances
   of this protocol:

   1.  It is unreliable.  Although there may be a link-layer protocol
       mechanism for a receiver to be notified that a frame has been
       lost in transmission, due to the unidirectional nature of the
       link-layer there is no in-band return path suitable for higher-
       layer acknowledgement of transfer success.  Any acknowledgement
       system designed to provide reliability MUST use a logically
       separate path from receiver back to sender.

   2.  It does not provide congestion control or signalling.  The
       underlying link-layer is expected to provide an uncontested
       channel between sender and receivers, and hence such mechanisms
       are considered to be out of scope.  The protocol MUST NOT be
       deployed in environments where congestion may occur, such as the
       public Internet, when the underlying link-layer does not provide
       suitable congestion control.

   3.  It requires an out-of-band mechanism for configuration.  This can
       either be via pre-placed static configuration, a parallel dynamic
       control-plane protocol, or some other mechanism beyond the scope
       of this specification.

12.  IANA Considerations

12.1.  BTPU Message Types Registry

   IANA is requested to create a new registry entitled "BTPU Message
   Types", in the existing "Bundle Protocol" registry group.  The

Appendix A.  Examples

   The following sections has examples of an implementation emitting
   Bundles into Link-layer PDUs.  Although the examples demonstrate the
   core principles, for example Bundle Segmentation with priority, the
   algorithm used to pack Messages into Link-layer PDUs is just for
   example purposes.  An implementation may use an alternate algorithm
   that meets this specification but suits its overall architecture, and
   where this is applicable is noted in each example.

A.1.  Segmentation of a sequence of Bundles of equal priority

   An example of the transmission of three Bundles of varying sizes and
   equal priority in three Link-layer PDUs is shown in Figure 3.

  +---------------------------+------------+-----------------+
  | Bundle A                  | Bundle B   | Bundle C        |
  +---------------------------+------------+-----------------+

  :                           :            :                 :

  +----------------------+----+------------+----+------------+---------+
  | Transfer 1           | T1 |  Complete  | T2 | Transfer 2 | Padding |
  | Segment 0            | S1 |  Bundle B  | S0 | Segment 1  |         |
  +----------------------+----+------------+----+------------+---------+

  :                      :                      :                      :

  +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
  | Link-layer PDU N     | Link-layer PDU N + 1 | Link-layer PDU N + 2 |
  +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+

    Figure 3: Segmentation of a sequence of Bundles of equal priority

   Bundle A is emitted as two Segments, included in the first and second
   Link-layer PDU, as Transfer 1.  Bundle B fits completely in the
   second Link-layer PDU, and is therefore emitted without segmentation.
   Bundle C is emitted as two Segments split between the second and
   third PDU, but padding is required to fill the third PDU.  An
   alternative algorithm could have selected to not segment Bundle C,
   but to pad the second PDU and include Bundle C without segmentation
   in the third PDU, without changing the semantics, as an
   implementation preference.

A.2.  Segmentation of a sequence of Bundles of different priority

   An example of the transmission of three Bundles of varying sizes and
   different priority in three Link-layer PDUs is shown in Figure 4.

                         +---------------------------+
                         | Bundle C                  |  High Priority
                         +---------------------------+
  +--------------+-----------------+
  | Bundle A     | Bundle B        |                    Low Priority

                         :                           :
  :              :                 :

      Figure 4: Interleaved segmentation of a sequence of Bundles of
                            different priority

   Bundle A is emitted without segmentation, and the Bundle B is
   segmented to fill the first Link-layer PDU.  During the preparation
   of the next Link-layer PDU high priority Bundle C is queued for
   emission.  Therefore the further emission of Bundle B is paused, and
   Bundle C is emitted as two Segments, with the third Link-layer PDU
   containing the second Segments of both Bundle B and C, plus padding.
   The order of emission of the second Segments of Bundle B and C makes
   no semantic difference.

A.3.  Repetition of Bundle Segments

   An example of the transmission of two Bundles of differing required
   repetition in three Link-layer PDUs is shown in Figure 5.

    Figure 5: Repetition of some Bundles within a sequence of Segments

   Bundle A is required by some higher-layer loss protection policy to
   be repeated twice in two separate Link-layer PDUs.  Bundle A does not
   require additional loss protection, and can therefore be transmitted
   once.  As Bundle A can fit in its entirety in a single Link-layer
   PDU, it is emitted as a Complete Bundle Message, with Bundle B
   emitted as a Segment Messages sized to fill the remainder of each
   PDU.  The Complete Bundle Message of Bundle A is repeated in the
   second Link-layer PDU, with the remainder of the second PDU filled
   with the next Segment of Bundle B.  The third Link-layer PDU contains
   the last Segment of Bundle B and padding.  An alternate
   implementation could have segmented both Bundles, and repeated the
   Segments of Bundle A whilst interleaving the Segments of Bundle B.
